These cities are multicultural with huge population.\nThese cities are featured as most livable cities in the world regularly and interested people are curious to understand this.\n\n\n### 1.1 Business Problem:\nAs part of this project we will try to compare the cities closely with the help of datascience tools and techniques and try to find an answer to the question as to how much similar or disimilar they are in terms of green spaces, restaurants, transportation and other major aspects of daily living in the nieghbourhoods.\n\nThe reason these two cities are selected is because they often feature in top as the most livable cities in the world. We would like to discover what makes them so.We will try to compare different aspects between them.\n\n### 1.2 Interested Audience:\n\nPeople who are interested in migrating to best places to live in and are unable to decide which one to choose amongst the one which are listed, we help them atleast to decide between these two cities. Similarly the exercise can be done with other cities featured regularly. ",

Vienna - Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Vienna\n   2. Melbourne - Government Data - https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/melbourne-profile/Pages/city-maps.aspx    \n   3. Global Liveability Data 2018 - https://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/The_Global_Liveability_Index_2018.pdf\n       \n### 2.2 Methodology Brief:\n\nWe will use above data sources to understand the neighbourhoods of respective cities. We will also use serives of Foursquare to explore geolocation data in terms of their neighbourhoods.This will include understanding neighbourhood data such as parks, hotels, landmarks, places of interest etc.\n\nWe will use KMeans machine learning technique to segment neighbourhoods with similar objects based on neighbourhood data and try to explore similarity and dissimilarity between two cities in question.",
